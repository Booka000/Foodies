# Foodies

A food delivery service app, it was built as a test task to apply for an internship. this is not a commercial project, the app doesn't provide any real services.

you can read the task requirements (in Russian!) [here](https://gaganpreetkaurkalsi.netlify.app/)


## Run Locally

Just clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Booka000/Foodies
```
open it in Android Studio, build it and you're good to go :grin:.  
The API is totally opened and doesn't require any keys or authorization
